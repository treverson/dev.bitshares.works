## Development Environments and Requirements

BitShares offers you to install BitShares-Core into different platforms; **Ubuntu (x64), OSx, and Windows**.  There are  dependencies to check when you download OpenSSL and  Boost. Please make sure which versions you downloaded. 

Also, if you are a Windows user, you have other two choices to install BitShares Core to your Windows (x64) Operation System.  One is **CLI-Wallet tools for Windows (x64)**, another is **Windows SubSystem for Linux (WSL)**.  

The CLI-wallet tools for Windows (x64) allows you to try several methods to get the data from BitShares blockchain without the BitShares Core installation. After you download the cli-wallet tools, you will find a cli_wallet executable to try Wallet API. 

Another option, Windows SubSystem for Linux (WSL).  This is for a developer who uses a Windows 10 (x64) Operation System and wants to build BitShares Core on Ubuntu. 

> See [System Requirements](../nodes_full_witness/full_nodes.md#system-requirements) to run a node (updated: 2018-07-02).

- [Contribution Guide Project](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/projects/6)


**BitShares-Core (Team) :**
This is a team of developers who manage BitShares-Core code updates and handle the issues that are submitted by developers. The team creates a project plan of next release and delivers to the Bitshares community about the Project information. 
  - **Roles** 
    - improving
    - maintaining
    - upgrading protocol if needed
    - making Project plans for the future release
    - creating/ announcing  Release 

## BitShares Core Code Management - GitFlow
This section describes and defines how changes flow into our code and through the various stages of development until it finally goes into production.

### Your purpose and a download branch
The below table list is just a guide. If you are interested to learn BitShares Node or CLI wallet, using TestNet might be adequate to start. If you are a developer who is interested to contribute to the BitShares Core team, downloading a developer branch might be a good start. Select an appropriate branch when you install BitShares-Core.  

After you know which branch to download, your next step is the installation of BitShares-Core. Check the [BitShares Installation Guide](../installation/README.md#install-a-development-environment) and select your Operation System to follow the installation steps. 

Your purpose might be trying some API calls to query the BitShares Blockchain data, using a CLI Wallet to manage your assets, or running a node. In any events, you will create an account and interact with the blockchain. If you install BitShares-Core, it would be a better understanding of the BitShares Node and System Requirements. So, we recommend you to read [the BitShares Nodes](../nodes_full_witness/README.md#bitshares-nodes-and-p2p-network) section and [BitShares Accounts](../accounts/README.md#bitshares-accounts) section before the installation.
