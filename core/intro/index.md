Welcome to BitShares! In this section, you will find the overview of BitShares Architecture (repositories and entities), and how the Core team processes the development work.  If you are interested in contributing to the Core team, you might want to check the Contribution Guide and the GitFlow to understand how BitShares-Core team handles the repository files and branches.  If you would like to know the Core team current project, issues, and the releases plans, check under the Issues and the Projects tabs.

## Observe BitShares blockchain transaction and performance

#### Bitshares Block Exploer
BitShares Exploere shows BitShares Blockchain information. You can observe BitShares Blockchain *Health* Status (head_block_num, head_block_age, chain_id, etc), how transactions processing, assets volume, members, etc.

If you would like to see more detaile information, the BitShares Open Exploere offers other information tabs (i.e.,Operations, Proxies, Markets, SmartCoins, UIAs, and Holders) to view.

#### Blockchain Activity
Blockchain Activity Matrix shows defferent tokens (assets) *Activity*, *Value*, and *Index*. It's interesting to check the CUI index is Capacity Utilization Index (a rate of blockchain daily activity to total blockchain capacity) to see how much numbers BitShares has.

## BitShares System Features

BitShares is a Finance Smart contract platform supported by Graphene technology - Blockchain.  
BitShares is designed from the ground up to process more transactions every second than VISA and MasterCard combined.

- Key points and fundamentals for the design:
- Keep everything in memory.
- Keep the core business logic in a single thread.
- Keep cryptographic operations (hashes and signatures) out of the core business logic.
- Divide validation into state-dependent and state-independent checks.
- Use an object oriented data model.
- Avoid synchronization primitives (locks, atomic operations)
- Minimize unnecessary computation in the business logic processor.
	
BitShares is built to aim high-performance blockchain and has been done to remove all calculations that are not part of the critical, order-dependent, evaluation from the core business logic, and to design a protocol the facilitates these kinds of optimizations
